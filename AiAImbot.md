# Ai AImbot(ChromeOS/Windows/Ios/Android/Xbox Support)

This is a JavaScript project that does what was once claimed to be impossible by an experienced javascript developer aka owner of betterxcloud
## Setup
Discord: https://discord.gg/EmdR3qgn8s

make sure ur not on fullscreen on xcloud and press ctrl + shift + i and go to the console tab,           (any other devives need you to search up how to get developer tools console)
copy both of the dependencies and any of the codes you want like gpu ai aimbot or cpu ai aimbot, then when you try to paste it in it might not work cause you need to type "allow pasting" or something like that, dw when u do it will tell you want u need to type to allow pasting, type that in then paste in the code based on the order below and it should work

basically run dependencies FIRST then run the ai aimbot and it should work if not then go to the discord for support
also this should work for geforce now but i never tested it, EVERY TIME you refresh you need to paste back in the dependencies then the ai aimbot for it to work


## Settings

Aim Intveral: Changes how fast the ai is, 350 is recommended for performance reasons but if u got a good pc u can try lower

basically everything else you should know like aim speed fov size etc

## GPU VERSION(works on integrated gpu also i have to put this here for retards)

so basically gpu version runs the ai on the gpu which will have better performance but doesnt mean it will completely get rid of lag and there is no possible "javascript fps booster 2025 working method edit: just proven to be possible with the (Best) models" without making the ai so ass that it barely works


## Best models

best model has 2x better performance and aiming and hits headshots only but still needs some working and it most likely works for other games than just fortnite and works super well


## GFN MODELS

since i work more on xbox cloud gaming models cause gfn crashes for me i got some random sexy godzilla dude to help me with gfn but thats like a 1 time thing, even tho i got gfns html its gonna be to complicated with him since he also is kinda dumb to get any
src from gfn so some stuff might not work idk but it should load perfectly just test it out

# Ai AImbot(ChromeOS/Windows/Ios/Android/Xbox Support)

This is a JavaScript project that does what was once claimed to be impossible by an experienced javascript developer aka owner of betterxcloud
## Setup
Discord: https://discord.gg/EmdR3qgn8s

make sure ur not on fullscreen on xcloud and press ctrl + shift + i and go to the console tab,           (any other devives need you to search up how to get developer tools console)
copy both of the dependencies and any of the codes you want like gpu ai aimbot or cpu ai aimbot, then when you try to paste it in it might not work cause you need to type "allow pasting" or something like that, dw when u do it will tell you want u need to type to allow pasting, type that in then paste in the code based on the order below and it should work

basically run dependencies FIRST then run the ai aimbot and it should work if not then go to the discord for support
also this should work for geforce now but i never tested it, EVERY TIME you refresh you need to paste back in the dependencies then the ai aimbot for it to work


## Settings

use common sense

basically everything else you should know like aim speed fov size etc

## GPU VERSION(works on integrated gpu also i have to put this here for retards)

so basically gpu version runs the ai on the gpu which will have better performance but doesnt mean it will completely get rid of lag and there is no possible "javascript fps booster 2025 working method edit: just proven to be possible with the (POSE) models" without making the ai so ass that it barely works


## POSE models

best model yet, has 2x better performance and aiming and very guud but still needs some working and it most likely works for other games than just fortnite and works super well


## GFN MODELS

i use xcloud more so these might not update faster or it might be older because gfn is a money hungry faggot company that crashes on the free version when u try to open fortnite but ill try to get it working or keep up to date incase yall like it but most likely never working

## EXPERIMENTAL MODELS

The soon b̶e̶t̶t̶e̶r̶ models that may have bugs b̶u̶t̶ ̶i̶ ̶w̶i̶l̶l̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶s̶e̶ ̶m̶o̶r̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶l̶e̶s̶s̶e̶r̶ ̶o̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶u̶r̶r̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶v̶e̶r̶s̶i̶o̶n̶, overall ill be working on more shittier versions in experimental and the ai aimbot(POSE) is gonna be the better one

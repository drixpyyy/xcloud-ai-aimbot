# Ai AImbot(ChromeOS/Windows/Ios/Android/Xbox Support)

This is a JavaScript project that does what was once claimed to be impossible by an experienced javascript developer aka owner of betterxcloud
## Setup

**Run the 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐬 first, then run the main script.**

Discord: https://discord.gg/EmdR3qgn8s

## Notes

- You have to run the dependencies everytime you load up the script if you refresh.

---

ok so to run this you have to simply go to fortnite(or any game with player/player like models as enemies) then when its loaded run the dependencies then hop into a match or creative match and run the main script

this is very bad when it comes to player models like peely or fishstick(i think) because the Coco-SSD(ai model used in this) looks for "Person" so it might not detect a massive banana on your screen with arms and legs

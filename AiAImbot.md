# Ai AImbot(ChromeOS/Windows/Ios/Android/Xbox Support)

This is a JavaScript project that does what was once claimed to be impossible by an experienced javascript developer aka owner of betterxcloud
## Setup
Discord: https://discord.gg/EmdR3qgn8s

make sure ur not on fullscreen on xcloud and press ctrl + shift + i

basically run dependencies FIRST then run the ai aimbot and it should work if not then go to the discord for support
also this should work for geforce now but i never tested it


## Settings

Aim Intveral: Changes how fast the ai is, 350 is recommended for performance reasons but if u got a good pc u can try lower

Controller emulation: Required for mouse movements to work, other than that its pretty useless its cause xcloud blocks any form of javascript that simulates mouse movements except extensions with the "Debugger" permissons and i alr got one that simulates mouse movements and clicks without any controller emulation it just chrome blocks the thing that installs the dependencies for the cheat

basically everything else you should know like aim speed fov size etc

## GPU VERSION(works on integrated gpu also i have to put this here for retards)

so basically gpu version runs the ai on the gpu which will have better performance but doesnt mean it will completely get rid of lag and there is no possible "javascript fps booster 2025 working method" without making the ai so ass that it barely works

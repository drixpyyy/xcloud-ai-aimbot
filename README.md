# AI AIMBOT(PLS READ THE INFO):


**ai aimbot**: AI AIMBOT(POSE) and DEPENDENCIES(POSE) copy both of them then load up xbox cloud gaming with fortnite or whatever game then ctrl + shift + i and if pasting doesnt work it seems like common sense but some people are dumb even tho it literally tells them so what u need to do is type "allow pasting" all lowercase just allow pasting then pasting should work then paste in the dependencies FIRST then ai aimbot, highly recommended you use FPS unlocker and the inputdelayoptimizations


**FPSUNLOCKER**: unlocks fps before its locked at 60 now its unlocked to 200 maximum


**InputDelayOptimizations**: attempts to lower mouse input delay


**Bug fixes**: if it doesnt use webgpu then its not using ur gpu or integrated gpu so go to chrome://flags search up webgpu and enable unsafe webgpu support and webgpu developer features but if u dont neeed them thats perfectly fine
